# Machine learning projects
This repo contains machine learning projects I've been working on. Most of them are built with Jupyter/iPython notebooks.
- [Building a logistic regression classifier from the ground up](https://github.com/redwanhuq/machine-learning/blob/master/building_logistic_regression_classifiers.ipynb)
- [Applying k-means clustering to flow cytometry analysis](https://github.com/redwanhuq/machine-learning/blob/master/k-means_clustering_flow_cytometry.ipynb)
- [Determining whether a mushroom is edible](https://github.com/redwanhuq/machine-learning/blob/master/mushroom_classification.ipynb)
- [Using natural language processing to build a spam filter for text messages](https://github.com/redwanhuq/machine-learning/blob/master/sms_spam_filter.ipynb)
